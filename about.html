      I am currently a Computer Science Major at Georgia State University. I enjoy programming in general, and like to practice by making small personal projects. I have a good amount of experience coming from personal coding projects, formal education, and an internship at Layer 3 Communications. I am very interested in functional and type-safe programming, and I especially love the language Haskell. I also like to play with graphics libraries such as SDL or Love2d, using Rust and Lua respectively.

    Beyond software, I also like to read a good book. My favorite is an oldie but a goodie, <i>The Hobbit, or There and Back Again</i>, by J.R.R. Tolkien. Currently I'm reading through the <i>Elric of Melnibone</i> series by Michael Moorcock. I like to watch mainly comedies and action movies or series. I have dabbled in football (real football, i.e. soccer), swim team, martial arts, and fencing. I play video games avidly too.
