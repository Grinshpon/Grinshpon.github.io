	  I wanted to write a blog so here it is. Consider this post the maiden post. The name is placeholder, or it might stay, idk. It means True/False in Russian. I came up with it as a reference to the Pravda newspaper, which was communist propaganda. This blog has nothing to do with commie stuff because I'm not a 12 year old anymore, or a liberal arts student, but I thought it'd be funny to name a blog something like that because I actually am 12.

	  I will use this blog to talk about mainly programming stuff, but also I may write about my hobbies, like video games and procrastinating. I will also try my hand at comedy. Avoid that. You can stop reading here.

	  This post is brought to you by Red Dead Redemption 2: Rockstar's most amibtious title yet.
	  This game has been in development for years, built off of the backbreaking work of its many developers... and it still didn't sell as well as GTAV.
	  It is a true roleplaying experience, where you can be whoever you want to be in this wild west: A gunslinger, a hunter, an outlaw, a bounty hunter, a fisherman, a gambler, or a racist.
	  You will come across many unique faces and personalities, and face off against rival gangs, lawmen out to get their reward, dangerous predators of the wild, common criminals, and democrats.
	  This is an expansive open world, where you can do whatever you want to do, except play on PC with a stable framerate.

	  Available now: Red Dead 3: Redemption 2: Manchester nil.
